# OtherAndSelfVenn
Venn diagram showing overlap of others and self using a slider

This is an R app created using shiny on request. The aim of the program is to use a slider to select how much 
overlap one perceives with other. The slider needs to be initialised at a random location on a 0-100 scale. The user can select
how much overlap they have and this will be reflected on a Venn diagram. On clicking submit button the app would return both the
selected overlap and the initial value.

## Requirements:
R studio

* install.packages('VennDiagram')
